# Ed25519 Security Contract

The Ed25519 Security contract is the Proof-of-Authority signer registry for Soroban-native WarpDrive processes. It uses ed25519 public keys (32 bytes), the native signature scheme of the Stellar network, making it the natural choice for processes that operate entirely within the Stellar ecosystem. It maintains a set of trusted Vectr operator public keys, each assigned a weight, and defines the threshold that must be met for an attestation to be considered valid. The admin manages the signer set -- adding operators when they join the project and removing them when they leave. The verification threshold is expressed as a fraction (`numerator / denominator`) of the total weight, allowing governance to tune the required quorum (e.g., 2/3 of total weight).

Signer weights are stored using a checkpoint system, which enables point-in-time lookups. This means the Verification contract can query "what was this signer's weight at ledger N?" -- critical for ensuring that attestation signatures are validated against the signer set that was active when the Vectrs actually produced those attestations, not the current set which may have changed since then.

## When to use this contract

Use the Ed25519 Security contract when your WarpDrive process operates natively on Soroban without needing cross-chain EVM compatibility. Vectrs in this configuration sign attestations with ed25519 keys following SEP-0053 message formatting, and the corresponding Ed25519 Verification contract uses Soroban's native `ed25519_verify` precompile for signature validation. This is the right choice for Stellar-to-Stellar workflows, Soroban contract orchestration, and any process where operators already hold Stellar keypairs.

For cross-chain processes that bridge with Ethereum or other EVM chains, see the [Secp256k1 Security contract](../secp256k1-security/README.md).

## Contract Interactions

**Ed25519 Verification contract** -- The Verification contract calls into this contract to look up signer weights (both current and historical) and to compute the required weight threshold. These cross-contract calls happen during every signature verification flow.

**Off-chain components** -- Project governance (a multisig, DAO, or single admin) manages the signer set through this contract. When new Vectr operators are onboarded, their ed25519 public keys are registered here. The `list_signers` query allows off-chain tooling to display the current operator set. Vectrs themselves do not interact with this contract directly -- they only need their own signing keys.

**Handler contract** -- The Handler does not call this contract directly. All Security queries flow through the Verification contract.

## Interface

The full interface is defined in [`Ed25519SecurityInterface`](https://github.com/warp-driver/warpdrive-contracts/blob/main/packages/shared/src/interfaces/security.rs).
